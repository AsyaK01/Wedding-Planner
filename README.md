The project "Wedding-Planner" is a web-based app for managing wedding events. It allows users to organize various aspects of a wedding, such as guest lists, event schedules and other details. The app includes a user-friendly interface for both clients and administrators, featuring functionalities like an event calendar, an admin panel for managing wedding details, and tools for uploading and displaying images.

The project uses PHP for server-side scripting, HTML for the webpage structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for dynamic behavior, and Bootstrap for responsive design. Additionally, the app is supported by a database for storing essential wedding information and files, ensuring the smooth management of all event-related data. The modular design makes it easier to update and expand functionalities.
